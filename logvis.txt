 1.0  Introduction ---------------------------------------------------

    This distributed.net program will generate a graph view of your
    distributed.net client's log file.  Start and End dates are
    adjustable.

 2.0  Opening a log file ---------------------------------------------

    For this program to work, your distributed.net Rc5des client needs
    to be setup to generate a log file.  Please refer to the documentation
    that came with your client to find out how to turn this configuration
    on.

    To open a log file pull down the File menu and select Open log file.
    If your log file has a .log extension, browse to the file and open it.
    If your log file has another, or no extension you will need to select
    "All Files (*.*)" from the Files of Type pull down menu.

 3.0  Logfile Visualizer Configuration -------------------------------

    To adjust the days that will be displayed:

    1   Right click anywhere in the open window.  This will display the
        Logfile Visualizer Configuration.

    2   Put your mouse over the left or right edge of the large bar at
        the top.  Your mouse will turn into a left/right arrow which you
        can click and drag to the left or right.  This will adjust the
        Start and End date viewed in the Logfile Visualizer. (Start and
        End dates are listed below and to the right of this bar.)

    3   To reset these dates, use the pull down menu for Starting date
        or Ending date and select the corresponding option, either Start
        of logfile or End of logfile.
