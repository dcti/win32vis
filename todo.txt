Here is a list of possible future things that could be improved in a 
future version of the Win32 Log Visualizer.  Feel free to attempt to
implement any of these changes (or others that you feel would be valuable)
and send your changes to bovine@distributed.net so that they can be
shared with all others.

- make contests listed in "View" menu become disabled if no data for that
contest was found in the logfile.

- separate log data by contests, and color code and indicate contest names

- add "export" function to dump parsed dates and keyrates into a
comma-separated text file that could be imported into Excel or some other
application.

- add parsing of personal proxy log files.

- localtime timestamp display

- mru file list.

- concatenation of multiple logfiles (with perhaps dashed lines separating
segments).  File/Open should allow multiple files to be selected, and
drag-and-drop should accept multiple files at once.

- mark fetch/flush operations in graph with vertical line

- save window size/position in registry
