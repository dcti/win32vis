Here is a list of possible future things that could be improved in a 
future version of the Win32 Log Visualizer.  Feel free to attempt to
implement any of these changes (or others that you feel would be valuable)
and send your changes to bovine@distributed.net so that they can be
shared with all others.


- separate log data by contests, and color code and indicate contest names

- add parsing of personal proxy log files.

- localtime timestamp display

- mru file list.

- concatenation of multiple logfiles (dashed lines separating segments)

- mark fetch/flush operations in graph with vertical line
